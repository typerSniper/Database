      Established in 1958, the second of its kind, IIT Bombay was the first to be set up with foreign assistance. The funds from UNESCO came as Roubles from the then Soviet Union. In 1961 Parliament decreed the  IITs as  'Institutes of National Importance'. Since then, IITB has grown from strength to strength to emerge as one of the top technical universities in the world.

The institute is recognised worldwide as a leader in the field of engineering education and research. Reputed for the outstanding calibre of students graduating from its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, the institute attracts the best students from the country for its bachelor's, master's and doctoral programmes. Research and academic programmes at IIT Bombay are driven by an outstanding faculty, many of whom are reputed for their research contributions internationally.

IIT Bombay also builds links with peer universities and institutes, both at the national and the international levels, to enhance research and enrich its educational programmes. The alumni have distinguished themselves through their achievements in and contributions to industry, academics, research, business, government and social domains. The institute continues to work closely with the alumni to enhance its activities through interactions in academic and research programmes as well as to mobilise financial support.

Arguably the toughest examination in the world, the JEE is conducted by the various IITs by a policy of rotation and is the sole criteria for admission in 23 institutes<br></li>
                    <li> In JEE-2016 more than 12,00,000 students vied for about 9,600 seats.

                    <li>In GATE 2016, more than 9,00,000 students vied for about 1,462 seats in IIT Delhi. Selection of MSc. (Master of Science) Students is through Joint Admission Test (JAM). MDes (Master in Design) students are selected via CEED.</li>
                    <li> With its challenging problems that test the depth of the aspirant’s knowledge, the surprise element of the continually varying pattern and the immense competition, clearing the IIT-JEE is considered the pinnacle of achievement for a student in India.</li>                    <li>Industry 4.0 introduces what has been called the “Smart Factory,” in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical processes of the factory and make decentralized decisions. The physical systems become Internet of Things, communicating and cooperating both with each other and with humans in real time via the wireless web. Students are ready for this next wave of Industrialisation and are well equipped to solve problems in this domain.</li>

Drilled in the sciences and problem-solving, the successful candidates are, by default, gifted, dedicated, hard working and blessed with analytical ability. While each one is a ‘topper’, in his/her own right, a leader in more than one sphere of activity, many are consistent toppers at the National Level with various prestigious scholarships and awards and a few even have proved their mettle at the international level, having represented the nation at International Olympiads and other Fairs, Seminars etc.</li></ul>
