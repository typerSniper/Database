    <h1>Programmes</h1>
    The engineering and science departments at IIT Bombay offer undergraduate and postgraduate programmes leading to B.Tech, M.Tech, M.Sc., M.Des., M.Phil or Ph.D. degrees. With this diverse set of programs offering different specializations, IIT Bombay has stayed at the forefront of emerging technologies.<br>

B.Tech.<br>
The four year Bachelor of Technology programme is offered in eight core branches of engineering. It is aimed at providing a basic foothold in various aspects of engineering. The salient feature of this programme is the yearlong B.Tech Project which exposes students to innovative technology and latest industrial practices.<br>

Dual Degree (DD)<br>
The five year Dual Degree programme pioneered by the institute in 1996 offers on completion a B.Tech degree in a basic engineering discipline and a M.Tech degree in the field of specialization. A fourteen months long Dual Degree Project forms an integral part of the programme, in which students tackle live industrial problems and do cutting edge.<br>

5 yr. Integrated M.Sc.<br>
The five year Integrated Degree programme for Master of Science is currently offered in Chemistry at IIT Bombay. The programme is on par with the B.Tech and Dual Degree programmes and is one of its kind in India. It is designed to equip the undergraduate students with basic engineering knowledge, besides inculcating enthusiasm and expertise for research in basic sciences. The one yearlong M.Sc project enables students to apply their theoretical knowledge, helping them to excel in diversified environments.<br>

M.Tech.<br>
The Master of Technology programme admits graduate students in core as well as interdisciplinary courses (IDPs), the duration of which is two years for a teaching assistantship and three years for a research assistantship. This programme takes a median between course work and research: most M.Tech students undertake teaching or research assistantship along with regular course work. The programme comprises of one or two years of course work to train students in high theoretical knowledge and a 15 months long M.Tech project which enables them to tackle practical problems of design and development as well as pursue active research. Interdisciplinary programmes admit graduates students from varied disciplines and tackle problems of diverse nature by understanding the meaningful connections that exist among various disciplines.

Interdisciplinary Programme<br>
The interdisciplinary programmes (IDPs) are designed to help students gain expertise in more than one technical field during the progress of the program by exploring the connections among the disciplines. The institute provides degree courses in several interdisciplinary areas such as Bio-engineering, Corrosion Engineering, Energy Systems, Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas (new program), Resource Engineering, Reliability Engineering and Systems &amp; Control Engineering.<br>

M.Sc.<br>
The two year Master of Science programme admits the very best of the science graduates of the country. Along with regular course work which helps to develop a strong theoretical base and an expertise in research, students take up the yearlong project which exposes them to various problems encountered in the industry. This enables them to apply their theoretical knowledge efficiently to solve practical problems faced by the industry.<br>

M.Des.<br>
Industrial Design Centre (IDC) offers Master of Design degree (M.Des) programme in Industrial Design, Visual Communication, Animation & Film Design and Interaction Design. The programme develops skills, knowledge and aptitude among students to become the creative problem solvers who can bring innovation. The diverse backgrounds like Engineering, Architecture and Fine arts along with flexible choice for electives and projects strengthen the cross disciplinary learning among IDC students.<br>

Ph.D. Programme<br>
The PhD programme offered by the institute consists primarily of an original doctoral thesis. The aim of this programme is to keep pace with the expanding frontiers of knowledge and provide research training relevant to the present social and economic objectives of the country. Interdisciplinary and interdepartmental research is actively encouraged by the institute, sponsored and development projects from industrial organizations are also undertaken. All PhD students are required to publish their thesis results in international journals. The average duration of the programme is about 4 years.<br>

M.Phil.<br>
The two year Master of Philosophy programme, launched in 1993, offers specialization in Planning and Development. The progarmme admits graduates from various disciplines and is aimed at training personnel in the formulation and interpretation of development policies. This programme involves one year of extensive course work and one year of project work.
